### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. I learned more about JavaScript and how to use it. One of the functions of JavaScript is the break and continue statement. The break statement breaks the loop and continues executing the code after the loop. While the continue statement, breaks one iteration and continues with the next iteration in the loop.
2. I also learned about an array. An array is a special variable, which can hold more than one value at a time. It useful when you you have a large amount of items, but you want to store them in a single variable
3. Another thing I learned in lesson was an event. An event can be something the browser does, or something a user does. In this lesson and the previous lesson, there were buttons that when you clicked, something happened. This an example of an event.
